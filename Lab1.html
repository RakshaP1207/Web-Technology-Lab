Ice cream is a frozen dairy product that typically consists of a mixture of cream, milk, sugar, and various flavorings. It is churned during the freezing process to incorporate air, resulting in a smooth and creamy texture. Ice cream can be served in cones, cups, or as part of other desserts like sundaes and milkshakes.
